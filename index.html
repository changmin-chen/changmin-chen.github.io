        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          I am a recent graduate with a master's degree in medical device and
          imaging, boasting extensive experience in medical data research and
          programming.<br /><br />
          My focus areas include signal processing, image analysis, and
          statistical analysis, and I have previously been involved in image
          algorithm development at a technology company.<br /><br />
          In addition to my technical abilities, my clinical internship
          experience has molded me into an outstanding team collaborator. I
          excel at communicating and working closely with colleagues, with a
          deep understanding of the requirements of medical imaging
          examinations.<br /><br />
          Furthermore, I bring international experience to the table, having
          interned at a hospital in Japan and presented my research findings in
          English at an international conference in Canada.
